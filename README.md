# HCI-Project-Memory-Loss
Human Computer Interaction (HCI) Project for patients with memory loss  

In this Project, we worked as a group of students from the SMU MSCDA course towards building a prototype that would enhance the life of caregivers for patients with memory loss. We had four deliverables and a final presentation showcasing our findings and output. We plan to take this idea further by entering the Idea Challenge 2019. The objective of this project was to build an application that made caregivers of Canadian memory loss patient's lives easier. It allows numerous functionality in keeping track of their loved ones and is aimed at both professional and family caregivers.
